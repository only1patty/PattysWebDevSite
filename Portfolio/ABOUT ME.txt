ABOUT ME

My name is Patty. 

I was born in the U.S., and now live in the United Kingdom.

I work as a freelance web developer specializing in web design, UI/UX design, and front end development. 

Giving life to people's ideas and translating them into a dynamic, pleasant online experience is the driving force behind my work. I am passionate about building responsive sites with compelling design.
